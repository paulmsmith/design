# Keep Going

In late 2012 Leisa published this on a website called 'The Pastry Box Project' every now and then I will look at it and soak it in.

The Pastry Box has gone but I found [the content in Github](https://github.com/the-pastry-box-project/pastrybox-archives-2012/blob/gh-pages/bakers/leisa-reichelt/2012-december-26.md).

So I made a post of it and added another motivational saying Ben Holliday used to end meetings and presentations with:

Keep Going
